# ðŸŽ¯ University Syllabus Management â€“ Backend Service

## ðŸ“– Project Purpose

This project is a backend service developed to power a **university syllabus management system**.
It was designed to be consumed by a separate frontend application, providing REST API endpoints to manage **Departments, Semesters, Subjects, and Syllabi**.

A **Spring Boot RESTful API** with a clean layered architecture (Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository â†’ Entity) that supports **CRUD operations** and integrates easily with any frontend (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).


# âœ¨ Key Responsibilities & Contributions

* Designed and implemented **RESTful APIs** for all core entities.
* Structured the project using **Spring Boot layered architecture** for scalability.
* Used **H2 in-memory database** for rapid testing and development.
* **Postman-tested** all endpoints before frontend integration.
* Prepared the project for **GitHub hosting** and team collaboration.


# ðŸ”¹ Features
**CRUD APIs** for:

  * Departments
  * Semesters
  * Subjects
  * Syllabi (with file upload support)
* Layered architecture for maintainability.
* In-memory **H2 Database** for quick setup and testing.
* Fully tested APIs, **ready for frontend consumption**.
* Easily switchable to MySQL/PostgreSQL for production environments.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
com.srija.syllabusproject
 â”œâ”€â”€ controller    # REST API endpoints
 â”œâ”€â”€ entity        # JPA entities
 â”œâ”€â”€ repository    # Spring Data JPA repositories
 â”œâ”€â”€ service       # Service interfaces

```

ðŸ§ª Testing
Postman Collection was created to test all endpoints (CRUD for Departments, Semesters, Subjects, Syllabi).

Each API was verified for:
    Correct request/response format
    Validation handling for incorrect inputs
    File upload functionality
    Database persistence in H2

Future plan: Add JUnit + Mockito unit tests for service and controller layers.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

* Add Spring Security with JWT for authentication & authorization.

* Implement Global Exception Handling for better API responses.

* Replace H2 Database with MySQL/PostgreSQL for production.

* Write JUnit + Mockito tests for automated backend testing.

* Add CI/CD pipeline for deployment automation.
